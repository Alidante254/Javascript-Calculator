# Javascript-Calculator

This project is a part of the Free Code Camp curriculum and aims to build a JavaScript calculator using React, CSS, and Bootstrap for styling.

## Project Overview

The JavaScript calculator challenge requires building a fully functional calculator using JavaScript and React. The calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It should also handle decimal numbers and support chaining multiple operations together.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to complete this project:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the calculator.
- Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework for responsive web design.

## Setup and Installation

To run this calculator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-calculator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd javascript-calculator`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the calculator in action.

## Usage

The calculator interface consists of a display screen and a grid of buttons representing numbers, operators, and other functionalities. Users can click on the buttons to input numbers and perform calculations. The result will be displayed on the screen.

## Development Process

1. Set up the project structure and initialize a React application.
2. Design and implement the calculator UI using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
3. Implement the logic to handle user input, perform calculations, and update the display.
4. Test the calculator thoroughly to ensure correct functionality and edge case handling.
5. Refactor the code, improve performance, and optimize the user experience.
6. Add additional features or enhancements if desired.
